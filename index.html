    <h1>A quiz program (Exercise 30) - 20 studypoints</h1>
    <h2>YOU NEED TO BE CREATIVE IN THIS HAND-INN! </h2>
    <p>Create a program with 7 different event listeners.
    </br>
    Mark the word different, this means that you have to use different eventlisteners!
    </br>
    A eventlistener could be:
    </br>
    "Click event", "mouseover event", "keydown event".
    </br>
    your program should have:
    </br>
    string, number, array, object, array, callback functions, functions, input fields, buttons, images
    </br>
    Your program should be at least 250 lines of JavaScript code
    </br>
    You need to hand-inn the exercise as a  website and NOT code -  if I want to see your code, I can always find with Chrome Developer Tool.
    </br>
    This means that you have to hand-inn your assignment as a link.
    </br>
    The link has to be placed in a pdf-file. You can use your own domain if you have a domain, or you can use GitHub pages.
    </br>
    Good luck with the exercise</p>
