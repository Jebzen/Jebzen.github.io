    <h1>A quiz program (Exercise 30) - 20 studypoints</h1>

    <h2>YOU NEED TO BE CREATIVE IN THIS HAND-INN! </h2>

    <p>Create a program with 7 different event listeners.</p>

    <p>Mark the word different, this means that you have to use different eventlisteners! </p>

    <p>A eventlistener could be: </p>

    <p>"Click event", "mouseover event", "keydown event". </p>

    <p>your program should have: </p>

    <p>string, number, array, object, array, callback functions, functions, input fields, buttons, images</p>

    <p>Your program should be at least 250 lines of JavaScript code</p>

    <p>You need to hand-inn the exercise as a  website and NOT code -  if I want to see your code, I can always find with Chrome Developer Tool.</p>

    <p>This means that you have to hand-inn your assignment as a link.</p>

    <p>The link has to be placed in a pdf-file. You can use your own domain if you have a domain, or you can use GitHub pages.</p>

    <p>Good luck with the exercise smiler</p>
