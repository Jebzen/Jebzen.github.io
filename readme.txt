A quiz program (Exercise 30) - 20 studypoints

string, number, array, object, array, callback functions, functions, input fields, buttons, images

Your program should be at least 250 lines of JavaScript code

You need to hand-inn the exercise as a  website and NOT code -  if I want to see your code, I can always find with Chrome Developer Tool.

This means that you have to hand-inn your assignment as a link.

The link has to be placed in a pdf-file. You can use your own domain if you have a domain, or you can use GitHub pages.
