            Babel is a free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ 
            code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines.

            webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can 
            transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. 
            webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
